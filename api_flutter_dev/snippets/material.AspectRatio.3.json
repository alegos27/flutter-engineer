    "description": "This third example is similar to the second, but with the aspect ratio set\nto 0.5. The widget still selects a width of 100.0 (the biggest allowed), and\nattempts to use a height of 200.0. Unfortunately, that violates the\nconstraints because the child can be at most 100.0 pixels tall. The widget\nwill then take that value and apply the aspect ratio again to obtain a width\nof 50.0. That width is permitted by the constraints and the child receives a\nwidth of 50.0 and a height of 100.0. If the width were not permitted, the\nwidget would continue iterating through the constraints.",
