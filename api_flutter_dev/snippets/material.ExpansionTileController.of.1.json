    "description": "Typical usage of the [ExpansionTileController.of] function is to call it from within the\n`build` method of a descendant of an [ExpansionTile].\n\nWhen the [ExpansionTile] is actually created in the same `build`\nfunction as the callback that refers to the controller, then the\n`context` argument to the `build` function can't be used to find\nthe [ExpansionTileController] (since it's \"above\" the widget\nbeing returned in the widget tree). In cases like that you can\nadd a [Builder] widget, which provides a new scope with a\n[BuildContext] that is \"under\" the [ExpansionTile]:",
