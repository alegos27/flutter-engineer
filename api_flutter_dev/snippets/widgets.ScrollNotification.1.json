    "description": "This sample shows the difference between using a [ScrollController] or a\n[NotificationListener] of type [ScrollNotification] to listen to scrolling\nactivities. Toggling the [Radio] button switches between the two.\nUsing a [ScrollNotification] will provide details about the scrolling\nactivity, along with the metrics of the [ScrollPosition], but not the scroll\nposition object itself. By listening with a [ScrollController], the position\nobject is directly accessible.\nBoth of these types of notifications are only triggered by scrolling.",
